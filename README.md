# Emojify
The iPhone app that soared to the top of Product Hunt, with thousands of users... Now open source!

🎺🎺🎺

# History
While he was "finding himself" last year, our glorious leader Nabil Freeman built Emojify as a bit of fun (🎉). Now, we'd like to share the code with everyone on The Internet to help people learn and produce their own apps faster. 😇🤔

Emojify will continue to receive updates whenever we feel like it, and you can find it for free (🚫💰) on the App Store here:

# YOU! (soulja boy tellem 😎💩🎵🎶🙉)

If you'd like to contribute, please just go ahead. Anything goes! We will ship your features and credit you on The App Store! ⚡️💪
