The iPhone app that soared to the top of Product Hunt, with thousands of users... Now open source!

# History
While he was "finding himself" last year, our glorious leader Nabil Freeman built Emojify as a bit of fun (🎉). Now, we'd like to share the code with everyone on The Internet to help people produce apps faster. 😇🤔

Emojify will continue to receive updates whenever we feel like it, and you can find it for free (🚫💰) on the App Store here:
